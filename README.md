I’ve just finished a complete end-to-end Machine Learning course covering:

- Data preprocessing

- Regression & Classification models

- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)

- Association rules (Apriori, Eclat)

- Reinforcement learning (UCB, Thompson Sampling)

- Natural Language Processing

- Deep Learning (ANNs & CNNs)

- Dimensionality reduction (PCA, LDA, Kernel PCA)

- Model selection & XGBoost

Hands-on experience with Python, building models, evaluating performance, and understanding real-world ML workflows.
